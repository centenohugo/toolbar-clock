# Minimalistic Toolbar Clock

A Chrome extension that puts a minimal digital clock in the browser toolbar.
The icon shows the time of one zone; click it to see all your time zones,
add as many as you need, and change the settings.

Built for Chrome and works in any Chromium browser (Brave, Edge...) with
Manifest V3. Only asks for the `storage` and `alarms` permissions.

2. Turn on **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and pick this folder.
4. Pin the extension from the extensions menu so it stays in the toolbar.
